# Mines
It's just a minesweeper clone written in C++ and QT5

Gamemode settings coming soon. 

# Build
Only been tested on Linux so far

Unfortunately I can't provide a `Makefile` since QT seems to make its own. I'm not sure how to get around that yet.

- `tui.cpp` is for the TUI frontend
- `gui.cpp` is for the QT frontend
